- 👋 Hello, I’m Will. I go by @hellowillay and Sir William.
- 👀 I’m a passionate researcher, developer, creator. I enjoy exploring new technologies and hope to eventually contribute to open source.
- 🌱 While I may not have a traditional Ivy League background, my commitment to technology knows no bounds. I've spent countless hours, late nights into the mornings hours learning through Codecademy and the AWS Academy, honing my skills in coding, cloud computing and beyond.
- 💞️ Whether you're looking for a dedicated contributor or just want to exchange ideas, I'm all ears. Let's connect and create something incredible together.  
- 📫 How to reach me, please leave a comment below or send me a DM? is that possible on here?
